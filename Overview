Question: Do more cars on the road contribute to a higher AQI?
An air quality index is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.

Sources for Data:
Resgistration source: https://tax.utah.gov/econstats/mv/registrations
AQI source: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html

Dashboard:

Observations: 
1. From 1997 to 2021, the count of registrations increased from 615,904 to 2,729,278. Roughly 4.4x its initial value.
2. From 1997 to 2021, the amount of days that CO & NO2 were the main pollutants decreased from 774 to 110. Roughly 1/7th its initial value
3. Salt Lake County has more than twice as many registrations as the next county, yet it is only 4th in Top 5 Counties Based on Days CO, NO2 as Main Pollutant
4. Washington County contains the 5th most registrations in the state, yet has only reported 2 days in 16 years where CO, NO2 is the main pollutant

Conclusion:
Based on this data, we cannot conclude that there is a direct coorelation to cars on the road contributing to a higher AQI.

Further Questions: 
1. Have car emissions gotten better to the point that a significant increase of cars on the road would not effect the AQI?
2. Are there other contributors to CO and NO2 that could be skewing these results? i.e. Refineries, farms
3. Would doing this with different states yeild similar results?
4. Does the land area of a county in realtion to the amount of registrations have an effect on AQI?
